# AI Learning Reflection - Fall Semester

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. The Overcomplicated Flask App
Early in the semester, I asked for help creating a simple Flask application with a cloudy background. What I got back was way more complex than I needed. As a beginner, I realized that having AI do everything for me wasn't actually helpful—I wanted to learn it, not just have it done for me. This taught me that "more help" isn't always better when you're trying to understand how things work.

**What changed:** I learned to be more specific in my prompts, breaking down what I needed and explicitly asking to "keep it simple" while also requesting explanations as we went.

### 2. The Discussion Board Project - When It Clicked
Working on a Flask discussion board was a turning point. I knew what Flask was but hadn't spent much time with it. Having concepts explained in plain terms while being shown how to implement them was incredibly helpful. Specifically, understanding how Flask routes work and how Flask runs versus how Streamlit runs made everything click into place. I had ideas about how these frameworks worked, but having clear explanations really solidified my understanding.

### 3. The Table Diagram Challenge
When working with Gemini, I asked for diagrams of tables made up of squares (1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 4x1) represented as simple rectangles with dashes. The first three worked fine, but the 4th table kept failing. Gemini would either skip it entirely or try to create a 3D furniture-style table instead of a grid. Eventually, I asked for a "2D diagram" which was clearer and easier for it to understand. This reinforced that what seems obvious to me isn't always obvious to AI—I wasn't specific enough about the visual representation I wanted.

### 4. Learning Which AI to Use
Not all AI platforms are created equal for coding help:
- **Claude**: Very good for coding in almost any language, but you need to be specific
- **ChatGPT**: Also very good and sometimes offers different perspectives—it's useful to have options
- **Gemini**: Newer to me, and I kept running into issues where it would handle the first few requests well but struggle with subsequent ones

### 5. How My Approach Evolved
**Week 1 vs. Now:**
- **Then:** Asked AI to build things for me
- **Now:** I attempt things on my own first, then use AI to check my work or help when I'm stuck

**Current use cases:**
- Checking if my code follows best practices for the language
- Debugging errors I'm having trouble figuring out
- Getting explanations when I need to understand something better

AI has become like a reliable study partner—always available and actually responds, which is more than I can say for some group project teammates.

## The Big Takeaway
**Be more specific and clear about what you need done and explained.**

How you word things matters. What seems clear to one person could be unclear to someone else. This applies not just to AI, but to communication in general—with teammates, in documentation, and when teaching others. Working with AI this semester has made me more aware of assumptions I make about what's "obvious" and has improved how I give instructions overall.

## Advice for Future Students
If you're about to start working with AI for coding, remember: be specific and clear about what you're needing done and explained. The more precise you are, the better results you'll get—and more importantly, the more you'll actually learn from the interaction.
