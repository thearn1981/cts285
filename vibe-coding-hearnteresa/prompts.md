SPA:

Prompt 6:
**what I asked:**
"what is a single page application? what frameworks are commonly used to build SPAs? which one would be best for rebuilding my tic-tac-toe game? explain why?"
Response: Explained that SPAs are web applications that load once and dynamically update content without page reloads. Listed common frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Solid.js) and recommended React for the tic-tac-toe game because it excels at state management, has a component-based structure perfect for game logic, large community support, and the current game structure already aligns with React patterns.

***What the AI did:** it explained what SPAs was and broke down each of the common frameworks and what they did.

**What worked:**  did a good job on explaining what it was and how it can be better.

**What didn't work:**  maybe a example of each of the framework to get a better understanding.

**what i learned:** there are sever different ways to do Single page applications.

Prompt 7:
**what I asked:**
"rebuild my tic tac toe game as a single page application using react. create complete working ersion i can test. explain what's different about using react for this"
Response: Created a complete React SPA version of the tic-tac-toe game (react-spa-tictactoe.html) with all features from attempt4. Explained six key differences: 1) Component-based architecture, 2) State management with hooks, 3) Automatic UI updates, 4) Side effects with useEffect, 5) Declarative vs imperative programming, 6) No manual event listener management. Highlighted benefits including easier reasoning, less bug-prone code, better maintainability, and improved performance.

***What the AI did:** created another html with react that had the same things that worked in the previous version.

**What worked:**  The game worked as it did in the previous verison 

**What didn't work:**  the main tic tac toe part is centered in the middle of this big page.

**what i learned:**  It works as it did previously but some more guidance on how you want it to look will be needed.

prompt 8:
**what I asked:** first player x or O that gets to 5 wins.. WINS and the round starts over
response: I'll update the React game to add a "first to 5 wins" victory condition that resets the round when someone reaches 5 wins.

***What the AI did:** created another html that had the same things that worked in the previous version this time who ever scores to 5 first wins.

**What worked:**  The game worked as it did in the previous verison except now the first to 5 won and then the scores were reset. 

**What didn't work:**  player now had to hit new game after every game before you did not.

**what i learned:**  sometimes asking for a new feature will break another one.
