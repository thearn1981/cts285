1. The AI as Collaborator
When did the AI help you most?
When did it frustrate you most?
What surprised you about working with AI?
When asking the questions of the AI it can be very help in generating or fixing
simple tasks quickly. Unless you are very specific it can also make the simplest 
of tasks way more complicated then it really need to be. Sometimes helping the 
AI understand what you mean by certain words like bubbly could make things go a 
little better. Overall I feel the collaboration with AI went well and the game
works. Of course there is still some work to make it look better that can be done.

2. The Framework Experiment
What did the AI recommend and why?
What was different about building an SPA?
Which approach felt better for YOUR game? Why?
If you were building something bigger, would your answer change?

The AI recommended using React created by Facebook/Meta because it was the best to 
balance of power and simplicity for the game. Just from looking at first version and 
the react version, I honestly can not tell difference but once you start click to play
the game does seem to respond a little faster on the react version.  Depending on what
I was building i would want to consider which approach would be best to use.

3. The “Vibe Coding Ceiling”
Did you hit a point where AI couldn’t help anymore?
When did you realize you needed to understand the code yourself?
What would you do differently next time?
In this example it was pretty easy and AI has come along so while there was some
minor tweaking the game worked on the first attempt. It can get frustrating when
you ask for something specific and it breaks something that was working before so 
being able to go and look at the code to try to figure out what happened verses trying
to ask the AI who may just make it worse. Having a good understanding of the programming pieces
is important. 

4. Growth Moment
What did this teach you about AI tools?
What did this teach you about web development?
What question do you have now that you didn’t have before?
AI can be a great tool and can be a great help or a great hindrance. Learning to 
talk with AI is important. There may be several different ways to ask AI for the same thing
and each response would be different.  It may delivery something super close to what you wanted but
having the knowledge to be able to look through the code and tweak things to make it the exactly the
way you were wanting it.  There is a lot of things that go into web development different frameworks to 
consider.
