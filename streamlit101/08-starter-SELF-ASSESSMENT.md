## Instructions

Score yourself honestly in each category using the rubric in RUBRIC.md. For each score, provide a brief justification explaining why you chose that score. Point to specific evidence in your submission.

Accurate self-assessment is a professional skill. Over-inflating scores suggests you don't understand the criteria. Under-scoring suggests lack of confidence. Both hurt your grade.
